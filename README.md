# SNAP-Diabetes-prevalance
## Overview
This is the repository for Data Science I's project. We want to analyze the correlation between long-term, structural food insecurity metrics and the diabetes prevalance across U.S counties. 
## Repository structure 
we organnized our files and outputs based on their function in the data pipeline: 
```bash
.
├── README.md
├── main_script.py                                    # Main python script for all steps

├── Data processing/
│   ├── data_raw                                      #Raw data we find in the wild
│   └── data_cleaned                                  #Tidy data after cleaning
